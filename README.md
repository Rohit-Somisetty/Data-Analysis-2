# 📊 Financial Health Analysis — Part 2

## 📌 Project Overview
This notebook extends the financial health analysis by applying **hypothesis testing, year-over-year trend analysis, and financial ratio calculations** to provide deeper insights into the company’s performance.  

It builds upon Part 1 (data cleaning, EDA, correlations) and continues using the same dataset:  
`financial_health_analysis_dataset.csv`

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed
### 1. Hypothesis Testing
- **Scenario 1**: Tested whether the **average monthly profit > $10,000** using a one-sample t-test.  
- **Scenario 2**: Tested whether **average revenue and expenses differ significantly** using a paired t-test.  
- **Interpretation**: Reported p-values, statistical decisions, and conclusions.  

### 2. Trend Analysis
- Computed **year-over-year (YoY) growth rates** for revenue and profit.  
- Identified **periods of significant change** using z-scores.  
- Visualized revenue, profit, and growth rates across years.  

### 3. Financial Ratios
- Calculated key ratios:
  - **Profit Margin** = Profit / Revenue  
  - **Debt-to-Asset Ratio** = Debt / Assets  
  - **Current Ratio** = Assets / Liabilities  
- Compared ratios against industry benchmarks:
  - Profit Margin ≥ 10%  
  - Debt-to-Asset Ratio ≤ 0.5  
  - Current Ratio ≥ 1.5  
- Highlighted whether the company meets or falls short of benchmarks.
